CTC-ASSIGNMENT 1

Human interpreter


Strategy A:
Prepare bunches of flexible paper sticks with 1/4” wide and 2” long. 
Pick three sticks to make an equilateral triangle. Each stick is one side of the triangle.
Choose one side and use two more sticks to make a new equilateral triangle. Do the same thing to other two sides. There will be three new triangles and six new sides. Each new side could make a new triangle with two more sides. 
Keep adding more triangles until all triangles could bent into a sphere. 

Strategy B:
Prepare bunches of flexible paper sticks with 1/4” wide and 2” long. 
First pick six sticks and fix each stick’s end on one point. Each stick paper has one fixed end and one free end.
Use another new stick to form an equilateral triangle with two adjacent sticks. Do the same thing to other four sticks. There will be a hexagon.
Then add four more paper sticks on each endpoint to make sure every point has six paper sticks fixed on it.
Repeat the step 3. Make sure every sticks are share with two equilateral triangle.
Keep doing all steps until forming a sphere.


What I write down
I write down the basic element of the form and how the elements grow up. The relationship between elements in 2D is explicit.

What I do not write down
How elements grow into a sphere is implicit. This is the part where I could not give specific instruction. 

If I translate these steps for computer, I need to give specific instructions about how paper sticks are bent into a sphere.
